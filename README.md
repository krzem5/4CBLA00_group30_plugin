# 4CBLA00 Group 30 Marc/Mentat optimization plugin

This repository has no documentation or commit history, as it only exists to showcase the source code of the Marc/Mentat optimization plugin used by me to calculate minimal failure loads of the 3D model created during the CBL course. Note that this repository will be deleted exactly **TWO WEEKS** after the due date of the final CBL assignment (the end of the examination period). If for any reason the access to this source code is required past the aforementioned deadline, feel free to contact me via email to resolve this issue.
